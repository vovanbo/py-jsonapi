jsonapi.base
============

.. sidebar:: Asyncio Version

    You can find the base and schema for asynchronous frameworks here:
    :mod:`jsonapi.asyncio`.

This is the *base* of the *py-jsonapi* library. It contains the definitions for
interfaces (schema, handlers), which can be used to implement a JSON:API
compliant API.


.. Remember to add a .rst file for each Python module listed here in the
.. correct docs folder.
